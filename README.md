# Factorio Blueprint Entity Replacer

This tool is used to change entities based on their name.

I needed this tool to convert my vanilla blueprints into Space Exploration blueprints, such as converting normal rails into space rails which can't be done with upgrade tool.

## Usage

* Paste your blueprint string into Input
* Input the entity names you'd like to change and change to.
* Press Convert and copy the string from output.
* Press Import String (<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>) in game and paste.
